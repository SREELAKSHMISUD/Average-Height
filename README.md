# Student Heights Calculator
This Python program calculates the total height, number of students, and average height from a list of student heights provided by the user.

## How It Works
User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a list of student heights as a comma-separated string.
String to Integer Conversion: The input string is split into individual height values, which are then converted from strings to integers.
## Calculations:
Total Height: The sum of all student heights.
Number of Students: The count of student height entries.
Average Height: The total height divided by the number of students, rounded to the nearest integer.
Result Display: The program prints the total height, number of students, and average height.
## Usage
Run the program.
Enter a comma-separated list of student heights when prompted.
The program will output the total height, number of students, and average height.
## Notes
Ensure the input list of student heights is properly formatted as a comma-separated string.
The program assumes that all input values are valid heights (i.e., non-negative integers).
